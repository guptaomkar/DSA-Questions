Exercise 1: In a computer system, N values are stored in the memory. A programmer needs to find out the largest and smallest value present in the memory. But the condition is, only one scan is allowed, multiple scans/passes are not allowed. Write a program to find the largest and smallest number from the given list of numbers in single pass. 

Exercise 2(any one):

A computer programmer stored the password to his account in an array. To keep this password safe he then rotated the array in anticlockwise direction N times. Now he wants to know his password. Write a code that takes following output:

·        N, number of elements

·        Elements of the array

·        R, number of rotations

Print the values after rotating the array R number of times.

Exercise 4: While storing the data (integer values) in a linked list, a programmer accidentally created two linked lists. Some of the data got stored in one linked list and remaining got stored in the other list. Both linked lists are in sorted form. Now the programmer wants to create a single list by combining the two lists in such a way that the newly created list should be in sorted order as well. Create a program that can perform this task.
